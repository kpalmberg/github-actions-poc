# About

I have extensive experience with Azure DevOps YAML pipelines. This repository is intended for learning about GitHub Actions and how it differs compared to Azure DevOps pipelines and other CI/CD tools.

## Linter

One of the test actions used in a workflow in this repository is [GitHub's Super-Linter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter) used to lint some test files for action testing purposes.
